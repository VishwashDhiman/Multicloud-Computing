# A Multi-Cloud Application


**AWS DynamoDB** is the NoSQL database service provided by AWS and **Azure Cosmos DB** is Azureâ€™s counterpart. After my research, I found that AWS Dynamo DB is the best option for our use case because it is very cost-efficient, and this service is provided in multiple different availability zones by AWS.  AWS Dynamo DB on-demand service costs around $3.88 per month. However, Azure Cosmos DB costs $31.70 per month for the same configurations and availability zones. 

Our goal is to find a NoSQL database which is Global availability and Highly scalable pricing. For that, AWS DynamoDB is the best option for us.
